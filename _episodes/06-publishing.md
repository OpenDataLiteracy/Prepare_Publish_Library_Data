## Local Civic Data Repository

We suggest that the best first option for publishing public library datasets is the local civic data repository for your area. This might be a city, county, or state data portal. Why? Discoverability! If those seeking data about government and civic agancies can find everything from one area in one place, they will turn to that repository for their local data needs. 

The first step is to find out if your city, county, or state (start hyperlocal and work your way out to larger areas) has a civic data repository. What do local civic data repositories look like? Here are a few examples:

- [City of Seattle Open Data Repository](https://data.seattle.gov/)
- [Sauk County Open Data Repository](https://data-saukgis.opendata.arcgis.com/)
- [Maryland's Open Data Portal](https://opendata.maryland.gov/)
- [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](http://www.wprdc.org/)

The City of Seattle and Maryland's repositories are built with Socrata software, Sauk County is built with ArcGIS software, and Western Pennsylvania Regional is built with CKAN software. We analyzed over 130 civic data portals and found that ArcGIS and Socrata are the most common software platforms used for civic data portals. We found smaller numbers of portals used software including: CKAN, JKAN, DKAN, Junar, OpenDataSoft, and custom software. We won't be providing instructions for how to publish on each of these specific software platforms, however we will provide advice on how to get started regardless of platform and will provide some examples of uploading data to a Socrata platform.
