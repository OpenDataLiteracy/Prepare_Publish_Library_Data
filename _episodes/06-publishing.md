## Local Civic Data Repository

We suggest that the best first option for publishing public library datasets is the local civic data repository for your area. This might be a city, county, or state data portal. Why? Discoverability! If those seeking data about government and civic agancies can find everything from one area in one place, they will turn to that repository for their local data needs. 

The first step is to find out if your city, county, or state (start hyperlocal and work your way out to larger areas) has a civic data repository. What do local civic data repositories look like? Here are a few examples:

- [City of Seattle Open Data Repository](https://data.seattle.gov/)
- [Sauk County Open Data Repository](https://data-saukgis.opendata.arcgis.com/)
- [Maryland's Open Data Portal](https://opendata.maryland.gov/)
- [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](http://www.wprdc.org/)
